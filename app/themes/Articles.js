    body: `The best way to be a good parent to your child is to nurture fun, friendship, teamwork, and intimacy in your own relationship as a couple. This creates an environment that helps ensure a good outcome for your child.
    \n \t \u25CF Try not to keep your concerns to yourself. Share your thoughts, hopes, and fears with each other.
    \n \t \u25CF Talk about what it will be like to be a parent. Talk about the challenges you may confront, like work and child-care issues.
    \n \t \u25CF Discuss your expectations, values, beliefs. Write down a job description for yourself and for your partner and then compare your expectations. You may be surprised at your differing perceptions.
    \n \t \u25CF Use creative problem solving. Discuss each other\'s point of view, during which time the problem will likely disappear; decide which problem you are really addressing; brainstorm on solutions, without limits; settle on one solution and on how long to try it before evaluating whether it is working.
    \n \t \u25CF Work on communicating clearly with each other by rewording your partner\'s statements back to him or her. You will not always arrive at agreement, but each of you will know your concerns have been heard.
    \n \t \u25CF Talk about how each of you deals with anger and conflict. Learn to use the timeout method to pause and regroup when less emotions are involved.
    \n \t \u25CF When giving either criticism or praise, try to be specific. Tell your spouse specifically what bothers you, and what pleases you.
    \n \t \u25CF Protect your times of fun and intimacy from problem solving. Arrange a regular couple meeting time that each of you knows you can count on to bring up issues and do the "work" of the relationship.
    \n \t \u25CF Make time for the activities that keep your own battery charged. Have your "me" time. Having time for your own interests becomes even more important after you become a parent.
    \n \t \u25CF Mothers need to let fathers be involved. The woman has to involve the man in the experience of pregnancy; the baby is not as real to him as it is to the woman experiencing all the changes of pregnancy. Do not assume that motherhood comes naturally. Share your insecurities and show confidence in your partner\'s ability to be a good and nurturing parent.
    \n \t \u25CF Anticipate stress and exhaustion. They are an inevitable part of being new parents. Eat well, exercise, take time for yourself, and recruit a support network.`,

  morningSickness: {
    title: 'Morning Sickness',
    subtitle: 'Despite its name, morning sickness does not only occur in the morning.',
    body: `Morning sickness symptoms typically start between weeks 6 to 9 of pregnancy. How long does morning sickness last? For the vast majority of expectant moms, nausea and vomiting typically subside between weeks 12 to 16 of pregnancy, with symptoms at their worst between weeks 10 to 16.
    \n So how can you help your partner manage their morning sickness?
    \n \t \u25CF Stay away from smells that trigger nausea, whether it’s the curry from your favorite takeout place or your formerly favorite perfume. A few other tactics can help. Try microwaving food, which usually results in fewer odors, and open the windows when you cook. Leave any place that smells so strong it’s making you ill. And wash your clothes more often with a lightly-scented (or unscented) detergent to get rid of incrusted smells. Steer clear, too, of foods that you can’t stand the sight of. Raw chicken, for example, is a common culprit.
    \n \t \u25CF Buy your partner a Sea-Band wristlet. These 1-inch wide bands put pressure on an acupressure point in the inner wrist. They’re widely available at drug and health food stores and have been shown to safely lessen pregnancy nausea.
    \n \t \u25CF Destressing can help minimize queasiness. Try encouraging your partner to practice classic stress-reduction techniques, like meditation and visualization or prenatal yoga.
    \n \t \u25CF Try alternative remedies, like acupunture or biofeedback. The effectiveness of these practices has not been scientifically studied but women swear by their effectiveness.`,

  paternityLeave: {
    title: 'What You Should Know: Paternity Leave',
    subtitle: 'A brief look into employer policies, alternatives, and more.',
    body: `What people refer to as paternity leave is the period of time when a father stops working because he is about to have, or has just had (or adopted) a baby. Sometimes this is called family leave or parental leave because this leave can apply to mothers, fathers, or domestic partners. A company may or may not have an official paternity leave policy, and paternity leave can either be paid or unpaid. Typically, however, in the United States, new dads do not receive paid time off after the birth of a new child.
    \n \t \u25CF Most American fathers receive no pay during the period after their child is born. New parents (of any gender) rely on federal law (called the Family and Medical Leave Act or FMLA) to protect their job for up to 12 weeks after a birth or adoption. This means that new fathers are entitled to return to their positions after a period of absence without penalty in pay or position. To be clear, FMLA does not guarantee any pay during this 12 week period. Also, FMLA does not apply to everyone. FMLA offers job protection during your time off if you qualify, i.e. if you work at a company with more than 50 employees within 75 miles of your workplace and you have worked there a minimum of 1,250 hours during the prior year. There are a few more requirements that must be met to receiving Family and Medical Leave Act protections (e.g. if you have a spouse working at the same company who also tries to qualify for leave under FMLA things are more complex). You can read more about FMLA rules and exceptions on the U.S. Department of Labor’s website.
    \n \t \u25CF  In addition to federal law, 25 states have supplemented FMLA protections by providing either longer leave (e.g. up to 16 weeks), lowering the minimum employer size to below 50, or even requiring private employers to pay for maternity leave or paternity leave (up to some cap). But as of 2018, the only states that require paid paternity leave are California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York state.
    \n \t \u25CF There is no perfect data on how many private employers cover paternity leave (on either a paid or unpaid basis). We do know that approximately 16% of private employers fund paid paternity leave programs based on a 2010 benefits survey from the Society for Human Resource Management. Fairygodboss has crowdsourced a range of corporate policies for thousands of companies from our members. Paternity leave is a feature of the parental leave database and as of 2016, there were 160 employers in the database that offered at least one week of paid leave for fathers. Some additional employers offered unpaid leave to new dads.
    \n \t \u25CF The only way to be sure that you do not qualify under a parental leave policy on a paid or unpaid basis is to ask your HR department or benefits administrator for information. Sometimes, your employee handbook will also include this information. Remember that while there may be an official policy about leave, you can always try to negotiate for more time or some pay during your time off (which is especially the case if you plan to continue working part-time).

    body: `There are certain life stages during which getting life insurance is essential to your family’s well-being. Having a baby is one of those life-changing and rewarding experiences. Your priorities shift, and one of your greatest concerns is protecting your new little one.
    \n \t \u25CF Getting the best life insurance rates possible is one way you can financially protect your growing family. Most pregnant women can still qualify for life insurance even while pregnant.
    \n \t \u25CF If you have seen a physician regularly and have pre-pregnancy or at least early-pregnancy cholesterol tests that the life insurance companies can review, this will help determine your rating since your levels may be elevated during pregnancy and while nursing. Some companies are more lenient on cholesterol requirements, but proof that your numbers are high strictly due to pregnancy will be helpful. Your medical records will provide this information. Many companies are willing to offer affordable life insurance coverage to you if you are carrying a single baby and have no complications. You may even be considered a Preferred risk class if you can meet certain criteria.
    \n \t \u25CF Further research can help you determine if life insurance would be a good idea for your baby `,

    body: `Women and men can both experience mental health issues during the pregnancy, as well as after the birth. For some people, pregnancy can lead to conditions such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder (less common)
    \n \t \u25CF Up to 1 in 10 women and 1 in 20 men experience antenatal depression. Antenatal anxiety is also common, and many people experience anxiety and depression at the same time. Certain factors can put you at greater risk of developing anxiety and depression during pregnancy. These include: past problems with your mental health, feeling you don’t have enough support, or problems with drugs or alcohol.
    \n \t \u25CF Anyone can have a mental health condition — it’s nothing to be ashamed about. To maintain your mental health, take long walks, practice meditation and breathing excercises, and visualize being a great parent for your child.`,
